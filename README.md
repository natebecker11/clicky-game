# A Game Of Clicks
A simple Memory-style clicking game built using React.

## Objective
The goal in building this app was to make a simple, nice-looking game using React. In the game, the user must click through several pictures of Game of Thrones characters. The pictures re-arrange themselves after every click, and the user must not click on any picture more than once.

## Technologies Used
* [React](https://www.reactjs.org) is the backbone of the app.
* [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) is an implementation of Bootstrap elements as React components, allowing for quickly building a UI in React.

## Future Development
This was a fairly simple and straight forward game, but it could be improved with some additional visual effects, custom fonts, and perhaps some sound effects/music.
